# Finding missing solutions

If you're looking for problems that don't have solutions yet in the language of your choice,
try running the [find missing solutions](./find-missing-solutions.sh) bash script. Pass it the file extension for your language 
of choice, and it will search the problem directories for problems that don't yet have a solution in
that language.

sample usage:
```
chmod u+x ./find-missing-solutions.sh
./find-missing-solutions.sh py
```
