Knights on a chessboard
=======================

This is a question that was posed to a friend of mine. He was given a laptop with visual studio and
a time limit of an hour and a half to produce the answer.

Given the following miniature chessboard:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>E</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>G</td>
    <td>H</td>
    <td>I</td>
    <td>J</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>K</td>
    <td>L</td>
    <td>M</td>
    <td>N</td>
    <td>O</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>P</td>
    <td>Q</td>
    <td>R</td>
    <td>S</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>U</td>
    <td>V</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Y</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Find the number of unique strings produced by a knight moving from square to square. 
A string is not valid if the knight moves onto a blank square and the string cannot 
contain more than two vowels.
