Atbash is a simple substitution cipher originally for the Hebrew alphabet, but possible with any known alphabet.
```
 Original:   abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz  
 Substitute: ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA
```

So you would substitute "a" in your input text with "Z" in your output text, "b" with "Y", "c" with "X" and so forth.

A few English words also 'Atbash' into other English words: "irk"="rip", "low"="old", "hob"="sly", "hold"="slow", "holy"="slob", "horn"="slim", "glow"="told", "grog"="tilt" and "zoo"="all". Some other English words Atbash into their own reverses, e.g., "wizard" = "draziw."
